Atomic
======

Atomic is a set of tools to calculate fractional abundance and radiation of
different elements in hot plasmas.


Installation and running the code
---------------------------------

Required code from OPEN-ADAS:
Download from http://open.adas.ac.uk/codes the xxdata_11.tar.gz 
and xxdata_15.tar.gz files, and extract their files into

    src/xxdata_11/
    src/xxdata_15/

Then

    $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace # to compile the extension module
    $ ./fetch_adas_data # fetch the atomic data

See below for details.

Launch ipython and try out the examples:

    $ ipython

    (in ipython) >>> %run examples/radiation.py


Compiling python extension module
---------------------------------

The extension module is compiled using numpy.distutils:

    $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace


Fetching the atomic data
------------------------

Atomic needs atomic data ionisation/recombination etc. coefficients.  These are
fetched from the OpenADAS [1] database.  In order to download your own dataset
run:

    $ ./fetch_adas_data

For description of these so called iso-nuclear master files see [2].

Testing
-------

Have nose2 installed.

    $ nose2

Test boilerplate was first produced automatedly with pythoscope, so
at time of writing (20160916) many tests are skipped. (S)
